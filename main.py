                        However, I can provide you with a high-level overview of the key steps involved in building a car:

                        Concept and Design: The process begins with defining the concept of the car and creating detailed design plans. Engineers and designers work together to determine the car's specifications, features, dimensions, and aesthetics.

                        Engineering and Prototyping: Once the design is finalized, engineers create computer models and prototypes to test the car's performance, safety, and efficiency. This stage involves extensive simulations and analysis.

                        Material Selection: Choose the appropriate materials for different components of the car, considering factors like strength, weight, cost, and manufacturability.

                        Manufacturing: Actual production starts with manufacturing different parts of the car, including the chassis, engine, transmission, body panels, interior components, and more. This involves various manufacturing processes like stamping, molding, welding, and assembly.

                        Quality Control and Testing: Every component undergoes rigorous quality control checks to ensure they meet the required standards. The car is also subjected to a series of tests for safety, performance, and reliability.

                        Assembly: After the individual parts are manufactured and tested, they are assembled together to form the complete car. This involves integrating the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical systems, and all other components.

                        Painting and Finishing: The car's body is painted and finished to give it the desired appearance and protection against corrosion.

                        Testing and Certification: The fully assembled car undergoes extensive testing, including road tests, crash tests, emission tests, and more. It must meet various safety and environmental regulations before being certified for sale.

                        Marketing and Distribution: Once the car is ready for the market, marketing and distribution strategies are put in place to make it available to consumratch as an individual is not practical or safe. If you are interested in automobiles and engineering, consider exploring careers in automotive design, engineering, or manufacturing.'''

        output_text='''Data is transferred over the internet through a network of interconnected devices. The process involves data encoding into binary code, dividing it into packets, adding destination addresses, and error-checking data. Routers determine the best path for each packet to reach its destination. The packets are transmitted through communication channels like fiber-optic cables or wireless connections.

                        The internet backbone, consisting of high-speed networks, connects major hubs and data centers, facilitating long-distance data transfer. Intermediary devices, such as switches and routers, direct packets along the optimal path.

                        At the destination, packets are reassembled to reconstruct the original data. During the transfer, acknowledgments are sent back to confirm successful receipt, and error-checking mechanisms request retransmission for any lost or corrupted packets.

                        TCP/IP is the foundational protocol suite for internet communication, ensuring reliable and orderly data delivery. This dynamic process enables users to access websites, send emails, and interact across the internet, making it essential for our interconnected world.'''

These protocols facilitate the delivery of data to their intended destinations. Some of the most notable protocols in the network layer are:

                        Internet Protocol (IP): The Internet Protocol (IP) is the fundamental protocol of the network layer. It provides the addressing scheme and routing mechanisms to deliver data packets across interconnected networks, ensuring data reaches its destination.

                        Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): ICMP is used for error reporting, diagnostics, and management of network devices. It is often used to check the availability and responsiveness of network hosts through tools like ping.

                        Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP): IGMP is used to manage multicast group membership. It allows devices to join and leave multicast groups to receive specific data streams efficiently.

                        Routing Information Protocol (RIP): RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that helps routers exchange routing information and determine the best paths for forwarding packets.

                        Open Shortest Path First (OSPF): OSPF is a link-state routing protocol that calculates the shortest path to each network by considering the link's cost. It is widely used in large-scale networks.

                        Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): BGP is a path-vector routing protocol used for exchanging routing information between autonomous systems (AS). It is the primary protocol that enables communication between different internet service providers (ISPs).

                        Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP): EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol designed to efficiently exchange routing information and reduce convergence time in a network.

                        These protocols work together to ensure efficient and reliable data transmission in computer networks. IP, being the core protocol of the network layer, plays a central role in determining the route that data packets take from the source to the destination. Other protocols, like ICMP, assist in network troubleshooting and diagnostics. The combination of these protocols enables data to navigate through complex networks and reach its intended recipients.'''

                        Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data delivery between applications. It establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transfer, and it guarantees that data packets are delivered in the correct order without loss or duplication. TCP also handles flow control, ensuring that data is sent at a rate suitable for the receiver's capacity to process it. It is widely used for applications that require error-free and ordered data transmission, such as web browsing, file transfers, and email.

                        User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides a lightweight, fast, and simple method for sending datagrams (packets) from one host to another. Unlike TCP, UDP does not establish a connection before data transfer and does not guarantee reliable delivery or packet ordering. As a result, UDP is considered less reliable than TCP but is preferred for real-time applications like audio and video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). These applications can tolerate some data loss and are more concerned with minimizing latency.

                        Both TCP and UDP serve distinct purposes and are used based on the specific requirements of the applications they support. TCP is ideal for applications that prioritize data integrity and accuracy, while UDP is suitable for applications where low latency and speed are essential, and some data loss can be tolerated.'''
